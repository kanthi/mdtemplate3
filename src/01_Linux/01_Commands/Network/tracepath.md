# tracepath
===========

tracepath,  tracepath6  - traces path to a network host discovering MTU  along this path

It traces path to destination discovering MTU along this path.  It uses UDP  port  port or some random port.  It is similar to traceroute, only
does not not require superuser privileges and has no fancy options. tracepath6 is good replacement for traceroute6 and classic  example  of
application  of  Linux  error  queues.  The situation with tracepath is worse, because commercial IP routers do not return  enough  information
in  icmp  error  messages.  Probably, it will change, when they will be updated.  For now it uses Van Jacobsonâ€™s trick, sweeping a range of UDP
ports to maintain trace history.

	     Too many hops: pmtu 1500
	     Resume: pmtu 1500 


Note:

You should kill the program with a CTRL-C when asterisks ("*") begin to appear, as the final stage of the trace-route is failing. This means that the server in the last stage failed to respond.
